            <h2>Why Bruges?</h2>
            <h3>Bruges, a medieval town with picturesque canals</h3>
            <p>
              The medieval architecture in Bruges is mostly intact, making it
              one of the best-preserved medieval towns in Europe. The "Historic
              Centre of Bruges" has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since
              2000. Its medieval buildings include the Church of Our Lady, whose
              brick spire reaches 115.6 m (379.27 ft), making it the world's
              second-highest brick tower/building. Bruges' best-known landmark
              is the Belfry of Bruges, a 13th-century belfry housing a municipal
              carillon comprising 47 bells. The sculpture Madonna and Child,
              which can be seen in the transept, is believed to be the only of
              Michelangelo's sculptures to have left Italy within his lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from it's medieval buildings, Bruges is one of the most
              romantic destinations: looking at the romantic canals and walking
              on the charming cobbled streets and strolling around on the Market
              Square, famous for its multi-colored Gothic buildings, will leave
              you feeling like you've been transported into a real-life fairy
              tale or Disney princess movie! You can even take a ride in a horse
              and carriage should you want the full experience.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Nina and I live in Belgium. The first time I
              visited Bruges was during winter holidays with a friend as a
              birthdaygift to myself and fell in love with the ambiance and
              little village. I created this page as part of a project for
              SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
